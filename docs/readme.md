## Docs
``code_notes`` - An unorganized collection of what I think are important bullet points about the application code and structure. There's probably enough to justify using a tool like sphinx

``general`` - describes how to use the system

``metadata`` - how the metadata fields of the media files are parsed

``nfo_files`` - lists fields usable in nfo files
