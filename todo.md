## Feature wishlist
Support for timed lyrics

While a song is playing, allow setting the art as the overall page's background

Allow saving song searches as static or dynamic playlists, dynamic ones basically meaning you save the query and re-execute it next time the playlist is viewed

Save static playlists as both simple ID lists and as traditional filepath sets in a known format like m3u

Some kind of radio mode allowing you to shuffle through songs grouped by genre, artist or tags

## Other
* Should probably make a shell script to download getID3 and copy files from repo to the directory it'll be hosted out of
* I wonder if I could also make database initialization a part of that script. Not sure how the enums will interfere with that.
